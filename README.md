# Comprehensive Evaluation of Surgical Site Infection trends across California Healthcare Facilities


## 1 Abstract

The occurrence, prediction, and management of surgical site infections (SSIs) in hospitals across Cali-
fornia are the primary focus of this study. Our analysis uses statistical methods to test five hypotheses
related to hospital size, types of surgical procedures, and infection control success using the comprehen-
sive dataset from the California Department of Public Health. The dataset includes data points like
hospital characteristics, infection rates, and procedure counts. Complex observations, such as the rela-
tionship between hospital bed capacity and average SIR, differences in SIR among surgical procedures,
and hospitals’ ability to reach the 2020 SSI reduction targets, are revealed by our data. These findings
have important ramifications for healthcare policy and hospital management methods, in addition to
adding to our knowledge of SSIs in various hospital settings.

## 2 Introduction

Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) continue to affect patient outcomes and healthcare costs. SSIs affect
patients and healthcare systems, as this paper will demonstrate. This research examines current SSI
knowledge to highlight the need to solve this issue. Background Surgical site infections (SSIs) are common
after surgery, causing harm to patients and healthcare providers. These infections might be superficial or
deep-seated. SSIs cause pain, lengthier hospital stays, and higher morbidity and mortality. Healthcare
expenditures for SSIs are rising, making them costly. Infections in the surgical site are common after
surgery. These infections range from superficial skin infections to more serious subcutaneous, organ, or
implanted problems. Despite sterile methods and antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical site infections (SSIs)
remain, highlighting the need for hospital surveillance and improvement.

SSIs in California hospitals are the focus of this research paper. The study also seeks to uncover
infection-causing factors. This investigation is important because surgical site infections (SSIs) can lead
to longer hospital stays, higher readmission rates, and even death. In a world of rising healthcare costs
and a focus on patient safety and quality, understanding surgical site infections (SSIs) is crucial.

In hospital infection control systems, SSI monitoring and mitigation have been crucial. Recent
advances in data collecting and analysis have provided new paths for understanding and managing
illnesses. These advances could help us understand infections and develop better prevention methods.
The literature has mostly examined specific surgical techniques or patient demographics.

The present study endeavors to make a valuable contribution to the wider discourse surrounding
healthcare quality and patient safety. This study aims to conduct an analysis of data obtained from
general acute care hospitals in California in order to identify patterns and risk factors associated with
surgical site infections (SSIs). The findings of this research endeavor have the potential to provide valu-
able insights that can be utilized to inform both policy-making decisions and clinical practices in the field
of healthcare. The exploration of this research endeavor offers valuable insights into the potential av-
enues for enhancing surgical procedures, improving patient outcomes, and optimizing resource allocation
within healthcare settings.


## 3 Data

This study examines 2022 California acute care hospital Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) using Data.gov’s
”Surgical Site Infections Data”. This dataset contains complete SSI data for analysis. The dataset
under evaluation is essential for understanding surgical site infections (SSIs) across a variety of surgical
procedures.

The process of data collection is a fundamental aspect of this section.Information and evidence are
collected to support research objectives and answer questions. The National Healthcare Safety Network
helped California general acute care hospitals collect and submit data. CDC securely manages the Na-
tional Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), an internet-based surveillance system. Hospitals meticulously
collect and publish data on healthcare-associated infections, focusing on surgical site infections. These re-
ports use common criteria and processes to collect data consistently and accurately. Healthcare facilities
must standardize data gathering to ensure consistency and enable meaningful comparisons. Healthcare
facilities can improve data comparability and analysis by standardizing data gathering. Standardization
is necessary for evidence-based decision-making and healthcare quality improvement.

Healthcare data gathering is extensive and dependable via the National Healthcare Safety Network
(NHSN). However, biases may affect the accuracy and validity of this system’s data. These biases should
be considered while reading NHSN data.

1. Reporting Bias: Hospitals may report Surgical Site Infections more or less carefully and accurately.
    Staffing and infection control resources contribute to these differences.
2. Selection Bias: This dataset may be biased because it only includes data from acute care hospitals,
    excluding other healthcare facilities that perform surgical procedures. conducted.
3. Detection Bias: Variations in Surveillance Intensity and Diagnostic Practices on Surgical Site In-
    fections Correctly identifying surgical site infections requires intensive surveillance and diagnostics.
    However, hospital-specific deficiencies in these criteria can cause detection bias, reducing SSI data
    reliability and comparability. This paper investigates how monitoring intensity and diagnostic
    techniques affect detection bias in SSI identification. SSI identification errors owing to surveillance
    intensity and diagnostic techniques are called detection bias. Hospitals’ diligence in monitoring
    SSIs is called surveillance intensity.

During the data cleaning process, we identified specific columns in the dataset that were deemed un-
necessary for our research and consequently removed. It is essential to optimize the dataset by prioritizing
the most pertinent information. The columns that have been eliminated are:

1. HAI: The content of this column, which pertained to healthcare-associated infections, was consid-
    ered irrelevant to the precise objective of our study.
2. State: The inclusion of the state column was unnecessary in our investigation as we solely examined
    hospitals in California.
3. Year: The year column has been excluded as our research is limited to data from a certain year,
    rendering this column insignificant.
4. Notes: Supplementary remarks or unstructured data that may not directly add to the quantitative
    analysis were also excluded.

In conducting a comprehensive analysis, it is crucial to identify and consider the key features that are
relevant to the research topic. These features serve as the foundation for the analysis and provide valuable
insights into the subject matter. This paper aims to outline the important features that should be The
dataset encompasses a multitude of significant features, or columns, that are of utmost importance for
the subsequent analysis.
The comprehension of these characteristics is imperative in order to conduct a precise analysis of the
data and derive significant conclusions. The objective of this analysis is to identify recurring patterns,
evaluate potential risk factors, and assess the performance of hospitals in preventing surgical site infec-
tions (SSIs). By doing so, this study aims to make a valuable contribution to ongoing endeavors aimed
at improving patient safety and the overall quality of healthcare.

## 4 Methods

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves the initial
exploration and examination of a dataset to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns and
relationships within the data. EDA serves as a foundation for further statistical analysis and

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase played a pivotal role in comprehending the dataset and
priming it for more extensive examination. In the present study, a series of significant modifications and
analyses were undertaken.

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: - Standardization of Column Names: In order to ensure unifor-
    mity and facilitate ease of access, the column names were subjected to a standardization process.
    This involved converting all column names to lower case and replacing any spaces with underscores.
       - Elimination of Repetitions: In order to maintain the integrity and distinctiveness of the
          dataset, any instances of duplicate entries were detected and subsequently eliminated.
       - Treatment of Missing Values: In order to ensure the integrity of the analysis, any rows con-
          taining missing values in key columns were identified and subsequently excluded from the
          dataset.
       - Data Filtering: In order to ensure the relevance of the data used in this study, a filtering pro-
          cess was implemented. Any data points that were deemed irrelevant, such as those pertaining to unknown counties or non-relevant surgical procedures, were excluded from the analysis.This step was crucial in order to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the findings.

- Data Type Conversion: In order to facilitate quantitative analysis, it was necessary to convert
    certain columns to their appropriate data types. This involved converting categorical variables
    into numerical formats.
2. Identification of Numerical Columns: - In order to conduct a quantitative analysis pertaining to
the study of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs), specific columns such as ’facilityid’, ’procedurecount’,
and ’infectionsreported’ were carefully selected for examination. These columns were chosen due
to their direct relevance to the research objectives.
3. Visualization: - In order to gain a better understanding of the distribution of key variables, his-
tograms were created for each numerical column. To enhance the visual representation, Kernel
Density Estimates (KDE) were incorporated into the histograms. This technique allowed for a
more comprehensive visualization of the data. The analysis conducted facilitated comprehension
of the dispersion, measures of central tendency, and potential skewness exhibited by the data.

Analytical techniques are a crucial aspect of research and data analysis. These techniques are em-
ployed to examine and interpret data in order to derive meaningful insights and draw valid conclusions.
In this paper,

1. Descriptive Statistics: - The present study employed descriptive statistics as a means of summariz-
    ing the data. Specifically, fundamental statistical measures such as the mean, median, and standard
    deviation were computed. These measures provide valuable insights into the central tendency and
    dispersion of the dataset under investigation. By employing these statistical techniques, a com-
    prehensive overview of the data was obtained, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the
    underlying patterns and characteristics.
2. Distribution Analysis: - The examination of histograms with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
    has yielded valuable insights into the distribution patterns of variables such as infection rates and
    procedure counts. The process of identifying any skewness or outliers in the data was deemed
    essential.
3. Binary Encoding of Categorical Variables: - The conversion of categorical variables, such as
    ’met 2020 goal’, into binary format was performed in order to render them appropriate for sta-
    tistical analysis.
4. Hypothesis Testing: - The purpose of this study is to conduct hypothesis testing in order to examine
    specific hypotheses pertaining to the prevalence of surgical site infections (SSIs) and the factors
    that influence their occurrence. The hypotheses will be formulated based on existing literature
    and will be tested using appropriate statistical methods. The findings from this analysis will
    contribute to the understanding of SSIs and provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals
    and policymakers in their efforts to prevent and manage these infections. In this study, we aim
    to conduct a comparative analysis of SSI (Surgical Site Infection) rates among various categories
    of hospitals. The objective is to examine the potential variations in SSI rates across different
    types of healthcare facilities. By exploring this topic, we hope to contribute to the existing body of
    knowledge on hospital-associated infections and provide insights into the factors that may influence
    SSI rates in diverse hospital settings.
5. Correlation Analysis: - The present study undertook an investigation into the relationships be-
    tween multiple numerical variables with the aim of identifying potential associations. This analysis
    involved examining the extent to which these variables were correlated with one another, thereby
    providing insights into the potential connections that may exist between them. By employing cor-
    relation analysis, the study sought to uncover any statistically significant relationships that could
    shed light on the interdependencies and associations among the variables under investigation.

Histograms depict California acute care hospi-
tal SSI numerical factors. Data input frequency
for unique-identifier facilities is shown in the his-
togram. Positively skewed distribution indicates

density-estimated histograms show most institutions have fewer operations, infections, and SIRs. The
skewness of these distributions means a few institutions manage most operation counts, infection reports,
and SIR values.

Comparison of Reported vs. Predicted Surgical Site Infections across California Counties.
```
This chart compares California county SSIs reported and projected. Actual infections are blue, while
expected infections for each county are orange. See the plot below.Los Angeles County has the most
reported and predicted infections, indicating a higher SSI rate due to population and surgery.Differences
between reported and expected values Los Angeles, San Diego, and other counties have unexpected SSIs.
This disparity may suggest surgical or postoperative complications.Most counties have close infection
records and predictions, indicating predictive effectiveness. The reporting system and model’s SSI es-
timation accuracy are proven by this alignment.Distribution of Data: Most counties predicted fewer
than 50 SSIs after the initial few. This may be due to hospital resource allocation, population density,
and state-wide healthcare access.County-specific analysis: In counties with high infection rates, county-
specific SSI data visualization can help allocate resources, target treatments, and improve surgical care
and infection control.Overall trends: Infections are decreasing from larger to smaller counties, suggest-
ing that populated places with higher healthcare resources have more SSIs. Patient volume, hospital
capacity, and procedure complexity may cause this.

Choropleth Map of Reported Surgical Site Infections by County in California.
```
The choropleth map shows California county-
level Surgical Site Infections (SSIs). Darker tones
on the map imply more infections, whereas lighter
shades indicate less. As California’s most pop-
ulous county, Los Angeles County has the most
SSIs, indicated in yellow. Lighter blue counties
like Orange and San Diego have less illnesses.
This pattern implies that SSIs are concentrated
in densely populated areas due to higher hospital
activity and patient flow.Most counties, especially
northern ones, have low SSI rates, as shown by
the dark purple to black coloration. These regions
may have lower population density, less healthcare
facilities, or better infection control.

Geographic trends and public health interven-
tion areas are clearly shown on the map. It helps
public health professionals and lawmakers allocate
resources and develop SSI prevention initiatives
across the state.

Surgical Infection Ratio Across California Counties by Operative Procedure
```
The graphic displays the surgical infection ra-
tio (SIR) data for several operating procedures in
different counties of California. SIR examines the
difference between expected and actual surgical
site infections (SSIs), while taking risk factors into
account. As we move from the left side of the x-axis to the right, we can see that the SIR values of the
counties listed later on are lower. The highest SIR rating, near 1, is for Alameda County, which means
that its SSI rate is almost the same as the national average or baseline for anticipated SSIs. The counties
of Kern, Mendocino, and El Dorado have higher SIRs, suggesting an unexpected number of SSIs, as we
move to the right. The median SIR level in the dataset is along the county lines of Napa, Lake, and Los
Angeles. San Mateo, Tehama, and Ventura counties all had lower-than-anticipated SSI values, and the
trend has persisted. The counties with the lowest SIRs, which means fewer SSIs than anticipated, were
Marin, Yuba, Monterey, San Francisco, and Humboldt. This might be because of local factors that are
influencing results, such as reduced surgery volumes, better infection management, or both.

 Heatmap of Correlation Between Numerical Variables
```
The heatmap demonstrates the association be-
tween surgical procedures and infections. Each
square in the heatmap shows the strength and
direction of the association between two vari-
ables, with the correlation coefficient values on
the right as color intensity and scale. Darker
purple indicates a higher negative correlation,
beige to pink a positive correlation, and black
no association.Starting from the top left corner,
’procedurecount’ and ’infectionsreported’ have
a strong positive association, which makes sense
since more procedures may lead to more infec-
tions. The positive connection between ’pro-
cedurecount’ and ’infectionspredicted’ suggests
that predictive models foresee more illnesses with
more operations.The association between ’proce-
durecount’ and ’sir’ is weaker, suggesting that
the number of procedures does not directly af-
fect the standardized infection ratio. There is a
positive correlation between ’infectionsreported’
and ’infectionspredicted’, indicating that predic-
tions match reported facts. However, both ’in-
fectionsreported’ and ’infectionspredicted’ have
negative correlations with ’sir’, suggesting that larger infection counts may lower the standardized infec-
tion ratio, possibly due to the ratio’s correction for procedures.

Top Facilities by Total Infections (Reported and Predicted)
```
The bar chart shows reported and expected
surgical site infections (SSIs) at various hospi-
tals. The y-axis lists facilities while the x-axis
shows infections. Blue bars show reported infec-
tions, whereas red bars show projected infections
for each facility. The chart shows Fountain Val-
ley Regional Hospital And Medical Center has the
most reported and forecasted infections. This may
indicate a larger facility or more surgeries. West
Hills Hospital & Medical Center had the lowest
counts but a large gap between reported and pro-
jected infections, with reported being higher. The
figure shows that many facilities have more infec-
tions than predicted, which may indicate greater
infection rates than predicted by models or bench-
marks.This illustration clearly compares reported
results to projections, which can help evaluate in-
fection control strategies and identify areas for surgical and postoperative care improvement.

This diagram shows violin graphs for surgical
and infectious numerical variables. Violin plots
show the distribution of data over multiple levels
of a categorical variable and its density at differ-
ent values.Procedure-count violin plot: A moder-
ate number of procedures is most typical, as shown
by this plot’s peak. The distribution declines as
operation counts grow, suggesting high procedure
counts are rare.Violin Plot of infectionsreported:
Reports of illnesses are clustered at low numbers,
with a lengthy tail at higher numbers. Most hos-
pitals report a few infections, but fewer report
more.Violin Plot of infectionspredicted: Like re-
ported infections, anticipated infection numbers
are skewed toward lower values but more evenly
distributed, showing the predictive model expects
a wider range of infection counts. Sir’s Violin Plot:

 Infection Trends Across Hospital Types: Reported vs. Predicted
```

The plot contrasts hospital bed numbers with
specialization-based reported and expected infections. The blue line shows reported infections, while the
orange dashed line shows projected infections at each facility type. Major teaching hospitals, usually
large surgical centers, have the most reported and expected infections. High patient volumes and difficult
cases are typical of such hospitals. As hospitals with fewer beds (Community greater than 250 Beds,
Community 125-250 Beds, and Community less than 125 Beds) execute fewer surgeries, both reported
and expected infections decrease. Critical access hospitals, which are smaller and rural, have lower
infection rates, as predicted. The lowest rate of infections is in pediatric hospitals, perhaps due to
specialized treatment and fewer invasive surgery than general hospitals. The predictive models appear
to be well-calibrated to hospital size and type, since reported and anticipated values are close across all
facility types. Healthcare administrators and policymakers need this graphic to assess infection burden
across hospital categories and plan infection control initiatives.

```
Breakdown of Reported Infections by Hospital Category: A Pie Chart Analysis
```
The pie chart shows healthcare facility type-
specific infection rates. Major teaching hospi-
tals, which account for 49% of infections, are pur-
ple. Due to their larger patient volumes and com-
plexity, large academic hospitals may account for
roughly half of infections. Community hospitals
with 125-250 beds account for 20.5% of infec-
tions, followed by those with more than 250 beds
at 17.1%. Community hospitals’ vast range of
services and procedures certainly contributes to
their high infection rates. Community hospitals
under 125 beds have 12.2% of infections, which
may be due to decreased patient throughput and
fewer high-risk operations. Critical access hospi-
tals, mainly rural, have a minor share of 1.2%. Pe-
diatric hospitals have a 0.0% infection rate, which
may imply a low rate. The figure clearly shows
where infections are most common across hospital types, which helps prioritize infection control strate-
gies.

## 5 Result

This segment conveys the outcomes of a sequence of hypothesis tests pertaining to the Standardized
Infection Ratio (SIR), a critical indicator utilized in the evaluation of infection control measures in hos-
pitals. By employing statistical analyses such as t-tests and proportion tests, we examine the relationship
between SIR values and variables including hospital size, procedural differences, and predictive accuracy.
The subsequent discussions provide a succinct analysis of each hypothesis, clarifying the potential con-
sequences for policies and practices in the healthcare industry.

### 5.1 Hypothesis 1: Hospitals with a bed capacity above 250 have a lower average SIR in comparison to smaller hospitals

Null Hypothesis H0:Hospitals with a bed capacity above 250 have a lower average SIR in comparison
to smaller hospitals.

Alternative Hypothesis H1:Hospitals with a bed capacity above 250 have a higher average Standard-
ized Infection Ratio (SIR) in comparison to smaller hospitals.

The purpose of our investigation was to assess how the size of the hospital influences, as measured by
the number of beds, on the Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR). The SIR is a vital metric for assessing
rates of surgical site infections. This study aligns with the overarching objective of understanding the
factors that impact hospital-acquired infections, thereby offering guidance for improving patient care and
hospital management practices.


#### Proportion of mean SIR among large and small hospitals

Approach
By drawing the analogy between the mean
SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) of large hos-
pitals (more than 250 beds) with the smaller
hospitals (less than 125 or within 125 to 250
beds) - a two sample t-test was used to con-
clude the hypothesis. The t-test is statistical
test (analysis method) helps to determine the
presence of a significant difference between the
means of two groups (based on hospital size
here).

### Findings
- Mean SIR for Large Hospitals (greater than
    250 Beds): 0.
- Mean SIR for Small Hospitals (less than 125
    Beds or 125-250 Beds): 0.
- t-statistic: -1.
- p-value: 0.

The t-test yields a P-value of 0.194, which is more than the traditional alpha requirement of 0.05.
Given these findings, the difference in the average Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) between large and
small hospitals is unlikely to be statistically significant. As a result, it is not plausible to claim that
larger hospitals have a lower average SIR when compared to smaller hospitals. In practice, the findings
of this study imply that the number of beds in a hospital has no significant effect on the Standardized
Infection Ratio, as demonstrated in the studied data.

### 5.2 Hypothesis 2: There is a significant difference in the average Surgical Infection Rate (SIR) between colon operations and cesarean sections

Null Hypothesis H0: There is no difference in the Standardized Infection Ratios between Cesarean sec-
tions and Colon surgeries.
Alternative Hypothesis H1:There is a difference in the Standardized Infection Ratios between Cesarean
sections and Colon surgeries.

In order to enhance our understanding of the factors influencing rates of surgical site infections, we
conducted a comparative analysis of different surgical techniques in our study. The primary objective of
our investigation was to assess the presence of a statistically significant discrepancy in the Standardized
Infection Ratios (SIRs) between Cesarean sections and colon procedures.


#### SIR between Cesarean Sections and Colon Surgeries

**Approach** 

To evaluate this hypothesis, a two-sample
t-test was employed. The statistical proce-
dure described herein is designed specifically
for the purpose of comparing the means of
two distinct groups that are independent of
each other. In the present context, a com-
parison is made between two groups: pa-
tients who have undergone Cesarean sections
and patients who have undergone colon opera-
tions.


#### Findings

- The investigation yielded a p-value of 0.604
- The t-static value of 0.
There is no statistically significant evidence to indicate the presence of a discrepancy in the average SIRs between Cesarean sections and colon
operations, as the p-value 0.604 is substantially larger than the conventional alpha criterion of 0.05. To put it plainly, the data does not lend credence to the idea that the SIRs for these two procedures are significantly different.

### 5.3 Hypothesis 3: A substantial percentage of hospitals have achieved or surpassed the 2020 target for SIR

Null Hypothesis H0:Half of the hospitals achieved the 2020 target for reducing the Standardized Infec-
tion Ratio.
Alternative Hypothesis H1: More than Half of the hospitals achieved the 2020 target for reducing the
Standardized Infection Ratio.

As part of our analysis to evaluate hospital performance in infection control, we focused on determin-
ing the number of institutions that achieved the ambitious 2020 target for the Standardized Infection
Ratio (SIR). This objective is a crucial milestone in the healthcare sector, indicating the efficiency of a
hospital’s infection control protocols.


#### Representation of percentages of Hospital meeting the goals or not

ApproachWe utilized statistical analysis to
ascertain the fraction of hospitals that successfully
attained the 2020 SIR objective. More precisely,
we employed a test of proportions to compare
the actual proportion of hospitals that achieved
the objective with a hypothetical proportion of
50%.


#### Findings

- Proportion of Hospitals Meeting the 2020 Goal: 68.44%
- The t-statistic is 17.
- The p-value is 9. 93 × 10 −^66
The research resulted in a very significant p-
value of roughly 9. 93 × 10 −^66 , which is far less than
the conventional alpha threshold of 0.05. The ex-
ceptionally small p-value provides strong evidence
to reject the null hypothesis that only 50% of hos-
pitals achieved the 2020 SIR objective. The dis-
covery that 68.44% of hospitals have achieved the
2020 SIR objective is evidence of the significant
endeavors and progress made in infection control inside these establishments. This suggests that a
considerably larger percentage of hospitals have successfully reached the objective in comparison to the
hypothetical benchmark of 50%. This result not only confirms the theory but also emphasizes the efficacy
of the strategies adopted by these institutions to manage and decrease infection rates.

### 5.4 Hypothesis 4: A notable disparity exists between the reported cases of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) and the projected figures derived from known models

Null Hypothesis H0:The mean reported infections are lower than the mean projected infections.
Alternative Hypothesis H1: The mean reported infections are not lower than the mean projected infec-
tions.


The objective of our study is to determine if there is a statistically significant disparity between the
reported number of surgical site infections (SSIs) and the projected number of SSIs in hospitals. This
comparison is essential for comprehending the precision of prediction models and the efficacy of hospital
infection control policies.


 #### Disparity between Reported and predicted infections

Approach In order to examine this hy-
pothesis, we used a two-sample t-test. This
statistical technique involves comparing the
average values of two groups, namely the
reported and expected SSIs in the data-
set.

#### Findings
- The t-statistic is -3.
- The p-value is 0.

The negative t-statistic indicates that the
mean reported infections are lower than the mean
projected infections. The p-value, which is be-
low the normal alpha threshold of 0.05, demon-
strates a statistically significant disparity between
the reported and expected infection rates. The
outcome confirms the hypothesis, demonstrating
a significant difference between the reported and
projected SSIs. The discrepancy may arise due to
several variables, such as the omission of develop-
ments in infection control techniques in the predictive models or the possibility of under reporting of
illnesses.

### 5.5 Statistical Analysis: The distribution of sample means of SIR for stomach procedures follows the Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a crucial statistical theorem that allows us to draw conclusions
regarding population parameters. The theory posits that as the sample size expands, the distribution of
the sample means will converge towards a normal distribution, irrespective of the form of the population
distribution. Understanding this idea is essential for comprehending the behavior of sample means and
for carrying out hypothesis testing.

#### Distributions of sample means across different sample size

Approach In order to verify the Central
Limit Theorem (CLT), we analyzed the charac-
teristics of the distribution of sample means ob-
tained from various sample sizes (10, 30, 50,
100) for the Surgical Infection Rate (SIR) as-
sociated with stomach procedures. We gener-
ated density plots to visually represent the dis-
tribution of sample means and examine the ef-
fect of larger sample sizes on the dispersion of the
data.


#### Findings

- The standard deviation of the sample means
    decreases as the sample size increases, in ac-
    cordance with the predictions of the Central
    Limit Theorem (CLT).


- The plots demonstrate that increasing the
    sample size results in a reduced variability
    of the sample means. The trend towards a
    sharper peak suggests a decrease in variabil-
    ity and a greater adherence to a normal dis-
    tribution.
- The phenomenon of the standard deviation
    dropping as the sample size increases is a
    well-known manifestation of the Central Limit
    Theorem (CLT). The statement confirms the
    underlying assumption of the theory, which
    states that as the sample size increases, the
    distribution of sample means will approach
    a normal distribution.

The density patterns found across various sample sizes offer empirical evidence for the applicability of
the Central Limit Theorem in the context of SIR for stomach procedures. As anticipated by the Central
Limit Theorem (CLT), the distribution of sample means tends to approach a normal distribution as
the sample size grows larger. This phenomenon indicates less variability and strengthens the theorem’s
validity for statistical analysis in healthcare data.

## 6 Conclusion

The study’s findings suggest that the size of a hospital and the type of surgical procedure performed
do not significantly affect Surgical Site Infection (SSI) rates. Additionally, the data indicates that over
half of the hospitals have met or exceeded the SSI reduction targets set for 2020, reflecting positively
on the current infection control measures. However, there is a notable trend of hospitals reporting
fewer SSIs than predicted, suggesting potential areas for improvement in infection tracking or reporting
accuracy. Overall, these results highlight the progress made in infection control while also underscoring
the importance of continuous evaluation and refinement of SSI prediction models and reporting practices
to further enhance patient safety.
