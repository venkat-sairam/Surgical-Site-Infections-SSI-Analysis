State,Plain Text,California
County,Plain Text,"The name of the California county where the facility is located, derived from COUNTY_CODE in the FACILITY table in ELMS, obtained from the facility's license application form."
HAI,Plain Text,Healthcare-associated infection (HAI): Surgical site infection (SSI) 
Operative_Procedure,Plain Text,"NHSN-defined operative procedure category identified by CDPH as consistent with meeting the requirements of California Health and Safety Code section 1288.55 for hospital reporting of SSI data.   The 28 reportable operative procedure categories are: Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, Appendix surgery, Bile duct liver or pancreatic, Cardiac surgery, Cesarean section, Colon surgery, Coronary bypass graft with chest, Coronary bypass w/ chest & donor, Exploratory abdominal surgery, Gallbladder surgery, Gastric surgery, Heart transplant, Hip prosthesis, Hysterectomy abdominal, Hysterectomy vaginal, Kidney surgery, Kidney transplant, Knee prosthesis, Laminectomy, Liver transplant, Open reduction of fracture, Ovarian surgery, Pacemaker surgery, Rectal surgery, Small bowel surgery, Spinal fusion, Spleen surgery, Thoracic surgery"
Facility_ID,Plain Text,"Facility ID is the primary key used to track facility information for all facilities stored in the Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) maintained by the  CDPH Center of Healthcare Quality, Licensing and Certification Program. "
Facility_Name,Plain Text,"Name of each California  general acute care hospital reporting  SSI (excluding superficial) for 28 adult operative procedures in calendar year, 2022. "
Hospital_Category_RiskAdjustment,Plain Text,"California general acute care hospitals are categorized into four major categories consistent with the categories NHSN uses for HAI risk adjustment: 1) Acute Care Hospital, 2) Long-Term Acute Care Hospital, 3) Critical Access Hospital, and 4) Rehabilitation Hospital or Unit. However, for SSI only the acute care hospitals have risk adjustment models that are also used for critical access hospitals."
Facility_Type,Plain Text,"Specific types of California hospitals are  Major Teaching; Pediatric; Community, >250 Beds; Community, 125-250 Beds; Community, <125 Beds; Long-Term Acute Care; Critical Access; Free-Standing Rehabilitation; and Rehabilitation Unit. A major teaching hospital is a hospital that has a teaching program for medical students and a post-graduate medical training program. A pediatric hospital is a hospital with inpatients predominantly age 18 years or younger. A community hospital is a CDPH designation for hospitals not classified as major teaching, long-term acute care (LTAC), critical access, pediatric, or rehabilitation. Community hospitals are further categorized by number of active beds as reported by the hospital in the NHSN Annual Survey. A LTAC hospital is defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a licensed general acute care hospital providing care for patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days. A critical access hospital is designated by CMS as a hospital with 25 or fewer acute care inpatient beds, located more than 35 miles from another hospital (with some exceptions), with an average length of stay of four days or less. A rehabilitation hospital is an acute care facility exclusively providing evaluation and restoration of function for patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. A rehabilitation unit is an inpatient ward within a general acute care hospital providing evaluation and restoration of function for patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. A rehabilitation unit typically has its own unique CMS certification number (CCN) and reports separately from the rest of the hospital. NHSN does not calculate an SSI SIR for rehabilation hospitals/units and LTAC hospitals and thus these facility types are not included."
Procedure_Count,Number,"Number of procedures performed from  January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022 and reported by a hospital via NHSN. "
Infections_Reported,Number,"The number of SSI reported by a hospital to the NHSN for procedures performed from  January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022.  Counts include only deep incisional and organ/space infections that are identified during hospital Admission or Readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries.  "
Infections_Predicted,Number,"The predicted number of SSI  calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline year 2015, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience."
SIR,Number,"The Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) is summary measure used to track SSIs over time calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The SIRs in this table were calculated using only complex SSI identified during hospital Admission or Readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries.  The SIR adjusts for patient-level and hospital-level risk factors specific to each procedure type.  NHSN calculates an SSI SIR when at least one infection is predicted.  CDPH calculated an SIR if the predicted number of SSI was <1 and >=0.2. The SIR and its comparison are not as precise as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections, but provide more hospitals with a published interpretation of their data.  NOTE: See NHSN's Guide to the SIR at the NHSN website: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/2015rebaseline/index.html."
SIR_CI_95_Lower_Limit,Number,Lower limit of the SIR 95% confidence interval  is computed using the exact Poisson distribution. The confidence interval quantifies the precision of the calculated SIR that is associated with random variation.
SIR_CI_95_Upper_Limit,Number,Upper limit of the SIR 95% confidence interval is calculated using the exact Poisson distribution. The confidence interval quantifies the precision of the calculated SIR that is associated with random variation. 
Comparison,Plain Text,"This field shows if the 95% confidence interval indicates the SSI incidence is significantly better, worse, or the same as predicted.  If the 95% Confidence interval for the SIR includes 1, the number of reported cases is not statistically significantly different from that predicted."
Met_2020_Goal,Plain Text,"Yes indicates hospital met the 2020 national HAI reduction goal, as recommended by the CDPH HAI Advisory Committee, in calendar year of 2022. From 2015 hospitals should have achieved 30% reduction in SSI  incidence (SIR<0.70)."
SIR_2015,Number,The 2015 standardized infection ratio (SIR) is a summary measure used to track HAIs over time. The SIR compares the number of reported SSI to the number of predicted SSI based on national baseline data. The SIR adjusts for factors that may impact the risk of acquiring a SSI. Hospitals with predicted number of SSI 0.2 will not have an SIR calculated by NHSN or CDPH.  
Notes,Plain Text,Note: Reported data exclude superficial SSI.| ¥ SSI SIR was calculated by CDPH if the predicted number of infections was less than 1 and greater than or equal 0.2. This SIR and its comparison are not as precise as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections.     
,,"Note: Because of rounding,  infections predicted appear to be 0.2, however,  if predicted is between 0.195 to 0.199 SIRs are not calculated"
